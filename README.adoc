= This component adds definitions for the ai_thinker_audio_kit_v2_2

The definitions are taken directly form [this repo](https://github.com/Ai-Thinker-Open/ESP32-A1S-AudioKit).

This allows you to use the default esp-adf instead of theirs. To activate the custom board it has to be activated in a separate option in the menuconfig.

== Installation
Add this repository as a submodule to your projects components folder.
```bash
cd [your_project_dir]
git submodule add https://github.com/raldone01/ESP32-A1S-AudioKit-Custom-Board-Component.git components/ESP32-A1S-AudioKit-Custom-Board
```
